  # ðŸŽ¤ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Wu-Tang Name Generator

### Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).


It looks a like it was styled in 2014, but I think it adds to the charm. 
I wrote the foundational code as genericly possilby so that it can be easily used to make simliar generators.
All in all, its works better than most of the generators that I played around with when I was a younger.
